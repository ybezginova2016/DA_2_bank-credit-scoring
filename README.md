## üè¶ **Bank Credit Scoring Project**

### **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze whether a client's marital status and the number of children they have impact their ability to repay a loan on time. This analysis will help inform the development of a credit scoring model, which is used by the bank to assess a potential borrower's ability to repay a loan.

### **Project Description**
The project involves exploring and analyzing data provided by the bank's credit department. The data includes information on clients' marital status, number of children, and their payment behavior. The goal is to identify any patterns or correlations between these factors and the likelihood of timely loan repayment. The findings will be used to enhance the bank's credit scoring system, making it more accurate in predicting a borrower's risk.

### **Data**
The dataset provided by the bank contains detailed information on clients' payment behavior, marital status, and number of children. The data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/DA_2_bank-credit-scoring/blob/main/data_bank_scoring_project.csv).

### **Project Methodology**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.
3. **Modeling:** Develop and test models to predict loan repayment based on the identified factors.
4. **Conclusions:** Draw conclusions from the analysis and provide recommendations for improving the credit scoring model.

### **Code**
The complete code for the project, including data cleaning, analysis, and modeling, can be found in the Jupyter notebooks:
- [Part 1: Data Cleaning](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/DA_2_bank-credit-scoring/blob/main/data%20cleaning%20(part%201).ipynb)
- [Part 2: Data Analysis](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/DA_2_bank-credit-scoring/blob/main/data%20analysis%20(part%202).ipynb)

### **Results**
The results of this project will provide insights into how marital status and the number of children influence loan repayment behavior. These insights will be used to refine the bank's credit scoring model.

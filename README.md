## üè¶ Bank Credit Scoring Project

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze whether a client's marital status and the number of children they have impact their ability to repay a loan on time. The analysis is based on data provided by the bank's credit department, which includes statistics on clients' creditworthiness. The findings from this research will be used to enhance the bank's credit scoring model‚Äîa system designed to evaluate a potential borrower's ability to repay a loan.

### Data
The dataset provided by the bank contains detailed information on clients' payment behavior and demographics. The data can be accessed here.
